Using Stable Diffusion's Variational Autoencoders for Image Compression.

<img src="Images\vae_example.png" width="800">

This project is currently a work in progress.

The ultimate goal of this project is to be able to compress images while maintaining the same quality of the original image and avoiding the introduction of artifacts.

RunwayML's Stable Diffusion v1.5 was utilized for the purposes of this project, specifically the lower storage-intensive 'pruned-emaonly' weight.
