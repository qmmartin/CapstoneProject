# Capstone Science Fair Project Logbook

## 9-25-2023

The project goal for today was to start implementing the VAE code while using the actual huggingface site as little as possible. 

Installed essential libraries Pytorch, Diffusers, and Transformers to python environment.

Wrote code that initializes a prompt and generates an image using it.

Changed README to include more information such as the project's ultimate final goal.
